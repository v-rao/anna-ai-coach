To validate a business idea, start by identifying your target customer and talking to them directly.
Run at least 5-10 customer interviews to learn about their needs and pain points.
A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should focus on solving one key problem with minimal features.
Define your target audience by identifying their demographics, needs, and buying behavior.
Market research can be done through surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis.
Revenue models include subscription, freemium, pay-per-use, and advertising.
Use landing pages to collect interest before building the full product.
Time-box your MVP development to avoid feature creep.
Test early and often with real users to collect feedback.
